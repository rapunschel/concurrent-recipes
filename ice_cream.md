Note: If you prefer a softer & sweeter ice cream, then use more punsch (liquor) or sugar respectively. If you prefer it more icy and firmer then use less alcohol and sugar. I highly dont recommend going above 1.5 dl liquor as it'll feel like ice cream shots.

## Ingredients

- 5-6 eggs
- 0.5-1.5 dl Punsch (liquor)
- 1-3 dl sugar
- 5-6 dl whipping cream

### Optional

- Chocolate

## Equipment

- Electric whisk or anything that whips the cream

## Steps

- Crack the eggs in a bowl and put the sugar in. Whisk it to a smooth texture then add the liquor and mix
- Turn the whipping cream into whipped cream
- Cut the chocolate into tiny pieces

- Mix everything together, optionally save some chocolate to add as sprinkles on top.

- Pour into containers and freeze for minimum 8 hours
