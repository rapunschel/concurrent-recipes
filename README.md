# Template recipe repository for the Concurrent Cooking website
Concurrent Cooking is a WIP website for collaborative cooking made by programmers for programmers.
Recipes are fetched from a selection of repositories based off this template.
Recipes consist of Markdown files structured like the [recipe template](recipe-template.md). 
If present, the README file, the template itself and any subfolders will be ignored when retrieving recipes from each repository.
